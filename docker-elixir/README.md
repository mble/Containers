# Elixir

This is a lightweight container running the
[Elixir](http://www.elixir-lang.org) language, suitable as a starting
point for running Elixir applications such as
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/),
[Relax](https://github.com/AgilionApps/relax) or
[Sugar](https://github.com/sugar-framework/sugar).

It is based off of the
[phusion/baseimage](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/phusion/baseimage/),
which itself is based off Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 'Trusty Tahr'.
