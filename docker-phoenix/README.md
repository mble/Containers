# Phoenix

This is a lightweight container running the
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework, a web framework
for [Elixir](http://www.elixir-lang.org).

It is based off of
[mble/docker-elixr](https://github.com/mble/Containers/tree/master/docker-elixir)
container, which must be available locally to build this container.

It is currently running the example Phoenix application on port 4000,
and is more just a proof of concept.
